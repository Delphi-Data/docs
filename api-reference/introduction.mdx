## Welcome

The Delphi API can be used to build interactive, AI data applications for your customers.

All functions that use large language models (LLMs) are grouped under `Delphi (Natural Language)`.

Note that settings and configuration should generally be handled via our platform UI, not API.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using two headers: `X-CLIENT-ID` and `X-API-KEY`.

Your API key is considered a secret, so it should only be used from the backend; you should not call these routes directly from your frontend.

The exception is the Delphi (Natural Language) `Chat Workflow` endpoint, which can be called from the frontend by using an `X-PUBLIC-TOKEN` header instead of your API key. This is combined with a JWT which represents the user's RBAC permissions in your Delphi semantic layer.

```json
"headers": [
  {
    "X-CLIENT-ID": "delphi-labs",
    "X-API-KEY": "sk_###########################"
  }
]
```
