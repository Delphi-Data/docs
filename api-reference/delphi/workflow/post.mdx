## Authentication

This route can be called from the frontend, so authentication is slightly different than other routes.

To do so, include an `X-PUBLIC-TOKEN` header instead of your usual API key. This is combined with a JWT which represents the user's RBAC permissions in your Delphi semantic layer.

```json
{
  "headers": {
    "X-CLIENT-ID": "delphi-labs",
    "X-PUBLIC-TOKEN": "pt_1234567890abcdefghijklmnopq"
    "X-CUBE-JWT": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...."
  }
}
```
